  subheading: Behind the scene
  text: "As a subsidiary of Parlay games, BackstagePlay is backed by over 20 years of experience.  Parlay commenced operations in 1996, at the beginning of the online gaming sector, where it created, commercialized and patented the world’s first online bingo product. Since those early days, the Parlay (and Backstageplay) executive teams and their shareholders have incubated, pioneered and directed some of the earliest and most successful online gaming companies. That expertise and direction has created a significant, material and positive impact on an industry that did not exist in the 1990s and is today approaching $20 billion in sales.
<br /><br />
Parlay has since expanded its product lines to include web-based and mobile products offering a majority of the games typically found in land-based environments. The company has also created and licensed social gaming products, which have been used in the consumer services and Freemium industries in North America. Parlay’s core back-office technologies have also expanded over the years to provide robust customer management, support and marketing systems, as well as customizable, integration and/or deployable solutions which have been licensed by some of the most respected gaming and non-gaming brands in the world. These include IGT, GTECH, Virgin Games, Publishers Clearing House, Intralot, Intertain, FML Group of Companies, Caliente, Netplay TV, Mr. Green and now Backstageplay Inc..
<br /><br />
It is this experience and insight, along with the experience and insight offered by the executive team and board of directors, which will be used to direct and manage the rapid growth and success required to commercialize a social gaming system, in partnership with its Artist customers, that will change the way that Artists engage and monetize their fans through gamification."
